OutlookND
===================

This provides a few extra buttons in Outlook 2013 for sending messages in a timeframe (immediately; 1m from now; 5m from now). 

This was developed for my own use but feel free to adapt it to your own needs.

----------
Motivation
-------
I have an Outlook rule on my sent items that delays delivery for 5 minutes by default. I can send immediately if I choose to by tagging the message as "Send Immediately." I leverage Categories for this purpose, but the Category workflow in Outlook's Compose dialog is clunky. Hence, this Add-In. These buttons tag the message as "Send Immediately" (to circumvent my Outlook rule) and set the delivery time.

> Apply this rule after I send the message 
> defer delivery by **5** minutes
> except if assigned to **Send Immediately** category
